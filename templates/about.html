            <p style="justify-content: center; text-align: justify;">A stock market, equity market, or share market is
                the
                aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may
                include
                securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as
                shares of
                private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment in the
                stock
                market is most often done via stockbrokerages and electronic trading platforms. Investment is usually
                made with
                an investment strategy in mind. A stock is a financial instrument that represents ownership in a company
                or
                corporation and represents a proportionate claim on its assets (what it owns) and earnings (what it
                generates in
                profits). Stocks are also called shares or a company's equity.</p>

            <p style="justify-content: center; text-align: justify;">By country, the largest stock markets as of January
                2021
                are in the United States of America (about 55.9%), followed by Japan (about 7.4%) and China (about
                5.4%).</p>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Stock Exchange</h2>
            <p style="justify-content: center; text-align: justify;">A stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse) where
                stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares (equity stock), bonds, and other securities. Many large
                companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more
                attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. These and other
                stocks may
                also be traded "over the counter" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their
                stock
                listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.</p>
